Content-Based Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a **Content-Based Recommendation System** that uses real-world data fetched from APIs. The system processes user interaction data (views, likes, ratings) to recommend personalized content. Additionally, it evaluates the quality of recommendations using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Features
- Fetches interaction data (views, likes, ratings) from APIs.
- Merges and processes data into a structured format for analysis.
- Recommends posts based on a weighted score of user interactions.
- Evaluates recommendation quality using MAE and RMSE.
- Visualizes evaluation metrics with bar charts.
